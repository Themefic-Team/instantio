Instantio is a plugin designed to reduce your cart abandonment rate by streamlining the WooCommerce multistep checkout process. With Instantio's floating cart drawer, customers can skip the cart page and proceed directly to the checkout page in an instant. The entire WooCommerce checkout process takes only 15-25 secondsâ€”yes, you read that correctly!

All a customer has to do is add an item to the cart; a cart drawer will then appear with a checkout button. This allows for instant one page checkout on your WooCommerce-based store, all from a single page. Such a streamlined process encourages customers to complete their purchases and return for more shopping in the future.
